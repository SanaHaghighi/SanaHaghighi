## 🧠 Why I Design
I’m a **Computer Engineering graduate** specializing in **Human–Computer Interaction and UX research**.  
My work focuses on understanding how people **think, learn, and interact** with systems — and translating those insights into **meaningful product decisions**.

I design at the intersection of:
**research × data × interaction × play**

---

## 🛠 Build, Prototype & Iterate
*Prototypes are questions — iteration reveals answers*

- Unity‑based Interactive Systems
- Game‑Based Learning Environments
- Front‑end Collaboration & Prototyping
- Computer Vision & ML Prototypes

**Technical Stack**  
`Python` · `C++` · `OpenCV` · `Scikit‑learn` · `Git`

---

## 📐 Design & Research DNA
- User‑centered, not feature‑centered
- Evidence over assumptions
- Systems thinking
- Storytelling with data
- Design as experimentation

---

## 🌍 Beyond Design
Yoga · Visual Arts · Traveling · Hiking · Swimming  
I believe great designers learn from life, not just interfaces.
